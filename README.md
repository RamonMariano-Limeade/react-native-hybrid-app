# Note
### Android
- master branch is a very basic implementation of the hybrid application on Android.
- If you would like to see a real world code, switch a branch to 'react_service_architecture'. This branch showcases a practical hybrid application using Dagger2 for DI and RxJava2 for creating Observer Pattern.  ã€€

### iOS
- master branch is a very basic implementation of the hybrid application on iOS.
- You might want to use RxSwift or other Reactive programming library to implement Observer Pattern.
